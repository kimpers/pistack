# Arena

Fan out N parallel attempts at the same task. Read every candidate end to end. Pick the strongest as the base. Graft the best ideas from the others into it. Verify the synthesized result.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything. The arena runs autonomously and the list keeps phases from silently disappearing.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Cross-judge
4. Pick
5. Graft
6. Verify

## Phase A: Frame

The N candidates will receive the same prompt, so the prompt is the contract. Get it right before spawning anything.

1. State the artifact each candidate is producing.
2. Derive the rubric. State what success looks like for *this* task, then turn it into 3-6 concrete gradeable criteria. Concrete: `Adds a --dry-run flag that skips writes`. Vague: `code is correct`. The rubric is the picker's tool in Phase D; candidates only see the task.
3. Pick the configured `arena runners` panel per the integration contract. Default four independent slots, explicitly inherited models. Preserve N separately from concurrency and disclose same-model panels. For design-sketch tasks use `architect runners`.
4. Assign unique runtime output bindings for reports. Code candidates use local managed worktrees from a clean named base ref, one writer per cwd; never share a writable checkout. Return patches and handoff manifest paths, not assumptions that managed worktrees survive.

## Phase B: Fan out

Launch N fresh native pi-subagents candidates through the delegation contract, bounded by configured concurrency. Give each the task, shared grounding paths, unique runtime output binding or managed worktree, and instructions for both artifact and rationale. The parent owns all stages; runners do not fan out.

The rationale is mandatory. Without it, the parent cannot tell whether a candidate's structure is principled or accidental, which makes Phase E grafting unreliable. Each rationale names the alternatives the candidate considered and what it rejected.

Record every dropout. A content-level dropout may leave N-1 candidates if the task rubric still holds; design exploration still needs at least two distinct viable shapes. Launch/tool failures block recovery through the integration contract, not a silent N-1 success.

## Phase C: Cross-judge

After all Phase B candidates settle, select one model from the configured `arena cross-judge pool`, preferably a different family from the parent. Launch a fresh `pistack.analyst` with the rubric and complete candidates by path label. Disclose same-model review when necessary. It scores each criterion and recommends a base with rationale. Run it alongside the parent's complete reading, never while candidates are still writing. Do not treat partial artifacts as complete.

## Phase D: Pick a base

Read every candidate end to end before picking. Skimming N candidates surfaces only the candidate whose surface looks most familiar.

Score each candidate against the rubric criterion by criterion, not on holistic feel. Compare against the cross-judge. Agreement on the base confirms the pick. Disagreement means one of you is biased or the rubric was ambiguous. Read both rationales before deciding.

Pick the base on which candidate a future maintainer can extend most easily without breaking invariants. Prefer the cleaner boundary or smaller surface area when two feel tied, per the Laziness Protocol.

Record the pick and the reason in a short synthesis note alongside the base artifact, including the cross-judge's verdict.

## Phase E: Graft

Walk each losing candidate once more and identify what is worth porting into the base. The signal is usually one or two things per candidate, not most of it.

Fold each graft in by hand, per the **redesign-from-first-principles** principle skill. Don't paste mechanically. The result has to remain coherent under one mental model.

Record what was grafted, from which candidate, and what was rejected and why. The rejection notes are the highest-signal part of the record. Future readers learn from what you considered and dropped, not just what you kept.

When N candidates converge on the same shape, that is a strong agreement signal. Note the convergence in the record and ship the consensus shape. No graft is needed. When N candidates wildly diverge, Phase A was under-specified. Reframe and re-run rather than averaging the divergence.

## Phase F: Verify

The synthesized artifact has to hold up under the same scrutiny as any other output, per the **prove-it-works** principle skill. The arena does not earn you a pass.

If verification surfaces a problem the arena did not catch, either Phase A was wrong (re-frame and re-run) or one candidate caught it and you missed the graft (go back to Phase E). Don't paper over.

## Outputs

One synthesized artifact. One short synthesis note alongside, naming the base, the grafts (with source candidate), the rejections, the dropouts if any, and the verification result.
