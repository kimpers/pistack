### Authoring or modifying a skill

Read [the Pi integration contract](../../../../pi/references/integration.md) first. Paths in prose are relative to the poteto-mode skill directory unless explicitly linked.


**You own the skill's voice.** Agent-facing prose has a higher bar than human prose; unhelpful sentences become instructions.

1. Use [Pi authoring](../../../../pi/references/authoring.md) in an approved project/personal override or development fork, never installed files.
2. Validate the skill: frontmatter has `name` and `description`, referenced files exist, cross-skill links resolve.
3. Test cases if structural. Skip if subjective.
4. Run **Opening a PR**.

When in doubt, delete. Keep only prose that changes a decision. Tell it to do the thing and skip the reason. Explain only when the rule is confusing without one. Match tone to scope. Point at structural sources (types, READMEs, config) per the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill. Delegate to other skills by path. Don't restate. A workflow you keep hitting but isn't captured → propose a new skill.

**Reply:** summary of the skill, key design decisions, validation notes.
