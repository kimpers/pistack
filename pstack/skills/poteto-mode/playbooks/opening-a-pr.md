### Opening a PR

Read [the Pi integration contract](../../../../pi/references/integration.md) first. Paths in prose are relative to the poteto-mode skill directory unless explicitly linked.


Only for authorized implementation/publication. For read-only or no-PR scope, record the step skipped and return evidence without Git or forge writes.

**Worktree.** Preserve existing dirty work. Use native managed worktrees from a clean named ref for independent writers, or one authorized writer in the supplied cwd. Review returned patches and handoff manifests. Never reset, force-remove or stash unrelated work, and do not assume managed worker branches persist. Parent integrates accepted patches before authorized PR operations.

**Commits.** Commit liberally; rebase into small, ordered commits before opening PRs. Each commit is a future PR: landable, ordered to tell the story. Amend when the fix belongs in a just-made commit; new commit when separable.

**PRs.** Run the attributed local `/skill:deslop` over the diff before commit. Run `/skill:no-comments` before review. Write every PR title, PR description, and commit body with `/skill:technical-writing`, then apply `/skill:unslop`. Apply every technical-writing layer except Diátaxis. Use one word for each action, keep articles, and avoid `-ing` when a plain verb works.

**Titles.** Use Conventional Commits in the form `type(scope): subject`. Use `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, or `perf` as the type. Use the changed area, such as `pstack` or `poteto-mode`, as the scope. Keep the subject short and imperative. Apply the same `/skill:technical-writing` and `/skill:unslop` pass as the body. Name a real symbol when one carries the change. For example, `fix(pstack): retarget opening-a-pr babysit trigger`. Do not add a trailing period.

**Descriptions.** Use these sections in order. Drop a section when it is empty.

- `## Why`. State the intent and why this approach fits.
- `## Scope`. State facts from the diff. Name real symbols and paths. Name both sides of a rename or retarget. State what is in and out when the boundary matters.
- `## Tradeoffs`. State real choices only. Skip this section when there are none.
- `## Blast Radius`. State who and what the change touches. Explain why the change is safe or risky. If main is red without the fix, name the continuing cost.
- `## Verification`. State how you ran each check and its rigor. Name the real path, such as the actual project harness, Pi browser/PTY evidence, or targeted tests. State the outcome of each check, not only the command name.

After these sections, attach videos or screenshots when they prove a claim. Do not use `## Summary` or `## Test plan` boilerplate. A commit body does not restate its subject.

**Forge.** Resolve the forge before the first PR operation and keep that choice for create, edit, view, watch, and merge. GitHub CLI (`gh`) is the default. If `command -v origin` succeeds and Origin can resolve the repository, prefer `origin pr ...`; if Origin is absent or cannot resolve the repository, stay on `gh` and record the fallback. Do not require Graphite (`gt`).

**Size and stacks.** Prefer five narrow PRs to one large PR. A stack is a base-branch chain. The root PR targets trunk; each child branch rebases onto its parent's exact tip and its PR targets the parent branch. Create a child with `origin pr create --status open --base <parent-branch>` or `gh pr create --base <parent-branch>` according to the resolved forge. Retarget an existing child with `origin pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>` or `gh pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>`. Branch from trunk only for independent work. Rebase on trunk before substantial stack work.

**Readiness.** Open every PR ready, never as a draft. With Origin, pass `--status open`; with `gh`, omit `--draft`. If a PR still opens as a draft, run `origin pr ready <number>` or `gh pr ready <number>` according to the resolved forge. Run `origin pr view <number>` or `gh pr view <number>` before you refer to PR status.

**Babysit.** Opening a PR does not start a babysit. Post the URL and keep building. Finish the phase or stack first. Run a separate babysit pass only when the user asks for one after the whole stack exists. A babysit for each new PR stalls the build and spends checks on commits that later waves restart. Push back when feedback drifts from intent.

The parent schedules independent `interrogate` and `no-comments` passes and applies `deslop` before authorized publication. Packaged children return scoped patches/evidence without nested fanout or automatic PR creation. Opening a PR never starts a watcher or goal.
