### Orchestrate

Read [the Pi integration contract](../../../../pi/references/integration.md) first. Paths in prose are relative to the poteto-mode skill directory unless explicitly linked.


**You own the program, never the code. Author briefs, drain the queue, keep the frontier green, decide.** For a whole project handed to one standing coordinator chat: multi-day, many stacked PRs, dozens to hundreds of subagents, the human checking in twice a day instead of every five minutes. One task driven to a predicate is Autonomous run. One ambitious run needing a bespoke workflow is figure-it-out. Route here when the work outlives any single agent. Work one agent could finish inside the session's budget is not a program; measured head-to-head, this playbook's ceremony turned a half-hour 12-unit job into 1 landed unit while a plain agent landed all 12. Below that line, route to Autonomous run.

Ceremony must scale with the program. Every gate below prices in coordinator minutes; on cheap near-identical units, collapse it as each section directs rather than paying list price.

Three rules carry the rest.

- Completions are queue events, not interrupts.
- Every spawn and every resume carries the standing orders verbatim.
- The brief is the product. A vague brief fails quietly, and a worker must use native contact_supervisor for a blocking decision rather than guess.

Open a todolist with the steps below copied in verbatim. A step you skip stays listed with `skip: <reason>`.

#### Roles and placement

- **Coordinator (this chat).** Local. Frames, authors briefs, drains the inbox, owns the human report, makes judgment calls. It never authors or edits code: conflicted merges, restacks, and code changes are always tasks. Mechanically landing a verified unit (fast-forward or clean cherry-pick of a worker's commit, then push) is bookkeeping the coordinator may do itself on repos where local git is cheap; queueing finished work behind an idle stacker is how a deadline harvests nothing. The loop is agentic end to end. Agents are launched, joined, paused and resumed only through native pi-subagents per the delegation contract. State reads and writes go through `scripts/orch/orch.ts` at drain points, one command in and one line out, to conserve context. The CLI never spawns, waits, or wakes anything.
- **Track ownership.** Keep one parent coordinator. A track is a logical queue grouping, not permission for packaged children to spawn. The parent can schedule independent local worker/verifier phases with bounded concurrency, returning summaries at wave boundaries.
- **Worker / verifier.** Local Pi sessions only. Use one writer per cwd, native managed worktrees for independent mutations and isolated app state for live verification. Use configured roles and prefer a different-family verifier; disclose same-model limitations. MCP/browser/PTY verification requires an already discovered profile with explicit tools and loaded provider. Missing tools block the lane, not permission to widen it.

The parent retains orchestration. Preserve native child capability ceilings and `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD`; no assumed nesting depth or alternate executor.

#### Store layout

Create `orchestrate/<project-slug>/` only in an approved project-local artifact directory. Read [runtime](../../../../pi/references/runtime.md) first: U4 implements the gh-first resolver and retained bookkeeping, with fixture proof; installed-helper/forge integration still requires approved setup and qualification. Every file has exactly one writer; owners publish facts, readers aggregate at read time. Use `bun scripts/orch/orch.ts` for bookkeeping, written below as `orch`, while its canonical plain TSV and JSON stay readable without the CLI.

- `preferences.md` is the standing-orders register: numbered lines, one constraint each (model policy, stack shape and count, verification bar, forbidden paths, escalation policy). Paste it verbatim into every spawn and every resume; directives decay across resumes, and each dropped one costs a human turn. When you catch yourself restating an instruction, append the line before you act (principle-encode-lessons-in-structure).
- `overview.md` is the durable PR and issue DB. Append; never rewrite wholesale per event.
- `units.tsv` has one row per unit: id, track, state, branch, PR, head SHA, brief path. Update rows in place.
- `frontier.json` is the computed merge frontier, per Stack safety.
- `ledger.tsv` is the verification ledger, per Verification.
- `inbox/` holds completion pointers. `gates.md` parks human gates (question, options, default on no answer) so a completion flood cannot wipe pending user decisions.
- `decisions.tsv` is the trail via the show-me-your-work skill.
- `status.md` is derived from `units.tsv` and `ledger.tsv` at each drain, never hand-maintained; regenerate it from the tables instead of narrating events into it, because hand-churned boards get rewritten on every event and go unreadable.

#### The brief

Your prompts to agents are your only product, and a sloppy brief compounds into slop across the whole tree. Every spawn carries all of it; a field you cannot fill is a unit you have not scoped yet.

```
GOAL         one sentence, the outcome, executable by a stranger with no chat access
SCOPE        paths this unit may write; paths it may not; its exclusive worktree or branch
CONTEXT      pointers to files and PRs; upstream reports pasted in full when this unit
             depends on them, because workers cannot see siblings
ACCEPTANCE   checkable criteria, one per line
VERIFY       exact commands or the control-skill path, plus known gotchas
TIMEBOX      rough cap on runtime; on expiry, return partial findings and stop rather than run on
FORBIDDEN    no gt, no rebase, no force-push, no fixes outside scope, plus unit-specific bans
REPORT       status, branch, head SHA, PRs, verdict, what you actually ran, deviations,
             suggested follow-ups
STANDING     <preferences.md pasted verbatim>
```

Size the brief to the unit. A one-command unit gets the template collapsed to a paragraph that still names goal, scope, the verify command, and the report shape; a 4KB scaffold around a two-line edit costs more to write and obey than the edit. Local spawns may reference the standing-orders artifact; every resume receives consolidated current scope and standing orders.

A track brief adds its unit list, file/ownership boundaries, configured concurrency and rollup format (child, status, PR/head, verdict and evidence). The parent launches all phases; it does not delegate unapproved nested fanout.

A dependency is a context relay, not just ordering: undeclared upstream context makes the worker guess. Missing fields are a refuse-to-spawn condition. Audit one sampled worker brief per track per wave, concurrently with the wave it samples, never as a gate in front of it; a failing brief stops that track and fixes the track's brief contract, not just the worker, because brief quality decays late in a run. Never resume-chain a brief; respawn fresh with consolidated scope.

#### Steps

1. **Frame.** State the done predicate as something countable ("all 126 units merged, each ledger-verified `unit-test-verified` or better"). Quantify scope: units, rough effort, expected stacks, and the wall-clock budget. If one agent could finish inside that budget, stop here and run Autonomous run instead. Collapsing must not depend on another document being present: it means do the work directly in this session, plain workers where they help, verification inline, landing as you go, and none of the store, register, or pilot machinery below. Schedule landing against the budget: by roughly 70% of it, stop spawning and land what is verified, because finished-but-unlanded work counts as zero. Name the tracks per project. A contested decomposition or one-way door goes through the arena skill before the pilot. Present the framing once; reversible prep proceeds without waiting.
2. **Initialize approved bookkeeping.** First require explicit setup helper readiness and installed-helper/forge qualification; otherwise stop with that gate. After qualification run `orch init`. Initialization is not dependency installation. Open the trail via the show-me-your-work skill, write the standing orders before any spawn, and seed `frontier.json` from existing PRs with `orch frontier set --repo <repo-dir>`.
3. **Pilot.** Push one unit through the whole path: brief, worker, verification, stack entry, ledger row, merge. The pilot exists to falsify the brief template, the verify recipe, and the unit size while that costs one agent instead of fifty. Fix the contract from pilot evidence before any fan-out. Scale the pilot to the unit: on programs of near-identical cheap units, the first unit is the pilot, run as a normal unit with its verify command inline, and fan-out starts the moment it lands. The dedicated pilot pipeline (separate verifier agent, audit gate) is for expensive or novel unit shapes, not for clone-units where a serialized pilot has nothing to falsify.
4. **Scale.** Spawn a rolling window of workers up to the in-flight cap, refilling as children finish; blocking batches pay the slowest child of every batch. Track queues remain parent-managed; packaged children never orchestrate. Recompute ready work after each drain; relay upstream reports into downstream briefs; keep sibling communication upward only. The sampled brief audit runs alongside the wave it samples and stops the next refill on failure, not the current one.
5. **Drain.** Run the queue discipline below at every drain point.
6. **Land.** Landing is continuous, never a terminal phase: integration starts with the first verified unit and runs alongside the remaining waves. On heavy repos the stacker is a standing role from wave one, integrating as units verify; on repos where local git is cheap, the coordinator lands verified units itself per Roles. Keep the frontier green before upper-stack work; Stack safety governs. Advance `frontier.json` only on merge or reported new head SHAs.
7. **Close.** Drain the final inbox, reconcile every spawned agent to a terminal row (done, abandoned, zombie-reconciled), confirm the predicate on the real artifact, confirm every landed PR has a verdict for its current head SHA, audit the trail per show-me-your-work including its cross-model review, encode recurring corrections into `preferences.md` or the brief template. Leave the store intact; it is the postmortem.

#### Queue and drain

- On a completion notification, run `orch inbox push <agent> <unit> <status> [--report PATH]` and return to what you were doing. Never deep-review inline; a completion that needs review becomes a verifier unit. Never review a diff inside a drain.
- Drain in batches at four points: the end of a critical section, a track rollup, a frontier watcher wake (arm an owned event monitor per the Pi runtime contract), and before a human report. Begin each batch with `orch inbox drain`. Arrivals during a drain wait for the next one.
- Critical sections you finish first: authoring a brief, a stack operation, a conflict decision, writing a gate, updating ledger or frontier.
- Each drain classifies every pointer (landed, needs-verify, failed, zombie, noise), writes the resulting rows through `orch unit add`, `orch unit set`, and `orch ledger record`, runs `orch status`, then spawns the next wave in one message.
- Account for every spawned child at its track's rollup: arrived, respawned, or its scope explicitly absorbed. Silently redoing a missing child's work hides both the wasted spend and the coverage gap its result existed to close.
- A drain turn ends with the three lines from `orch status`: counts against the states, what changed, gates open. Detail lives in `status.md`; the full reply contract applies at checkpoints and close.

#### Stack safety

- The frontier is a computed object, never narrative. `orch frontier set --repo <repo> --prs <bottom-to-top PRs>` resolves gh base-branch topology and records branch names, forge head SHAs and a generation number. Recheck exact base/head SHAs independently before landing. Without `--prs` it discovers the current open linear stack. Missing, ambiguous or stale topology blocks landing; Graphite is not required.
- Exactly one parent-owned topology writer per stack may rebase/retarget. Workers never mutate topology. Babysitters follow `playbooks/babysit.md` against the pinned frontier generation and report conflicts to the owner rather than restacking.
- PR closes and retargets go through the stacker only; closing a base PR orphans every chain above it. Merges and stack surgery are units with briefs like any other.
- One retro watcher follows merged PRs for reverts, post-merge CI breaks, and orphaned follow-ups.

#### Verification

Scale verification to the unit. When VERIFY is a single cheap command, the worker runs it and reports the output, and the coordinator spot-checks receipts; a dedicated verifier agent (preferably on a different model family, otherwise explicitly disclosed as same-model review) is for units whose verification is expensive, judgment-laden, or high-blast-radius. A verifier agent whose entire product would be rerunning one command is ceremony, not verification.

Write ledger rows with `orch ledger record`. Check the current PR and head SHA with `orch ledger check`. `ledger.tsv`, one row per verdict, keyed by PR number plus head SHA: `live-ui-verified | unit-test-verified | type-check-only | verifier-blocked | verifier-failed`. CI green is an input to a verdict, not a verdict. Behavioral work needs better than `type-check-only`. `verifier-blocked` is not a pass; respawn when the environment heals. `verifier-failed` gets a fix unit, not a re-verify. A worker may self-report; a verifier overrides it on the same key. A new head SHA voids the row, so re-verify after restack. The ledger answers "was this verified", not memory and not the transcript.

A unit is not done until its output is externalized the moment it lands, never batched to the end of the run: a worker pushes its branch, a verifier writes its ledger row, receipts land in the store. Uncaptured local work is not accepted; retain runtime patch/handoff artifacts and verify them before a managed worktree disappears.

#### Liveness and failure

- Never resume an agent to check on it; a resume restarts an idle agent. Probe read-only: the ledger, `units.tsv`, `gh`, pushed branches, exact native pi-subagents run status and retained handoff artifacts. Transcript mtime is not liveness.
- A silent death gets a synthetic postmortem row in the inbox (unit, failure mode, last evidence, options). Replan on evidence as it arrives; never wait for full quiescence.
- Retry by mode: cap-hit or oom, respawn with smaller scope; network-drop, retry as-is; tool/launch/provider error, stop and report the infrastructure failure plus partial state. Only an approved same-protocol repair may retry; do not silently switch models or executor. Unknown failure gets one diagnosed same-protocol retry; two failures block the unit for a decision.
- A zombie that returns hours late reconciles against the current frontier and ledger before anything is accepted; the world moved while it slept. Salvage unique findings through a fresh unit, never a blind merge.
- When continued spawning would produce garbage tree-wide (bad upstream output, broken acceptance, dead infra), write a stop line at the top of the standing orders, let in-flight work finish, fix the cause, clear it.
- Bound your own infra retries the same way you bound a child's. After a few consecutive tool aborts, stop retrying: write a terminal handoff to durable state (what is done, where it lives, the exact command to resume) and end the run. Hours of retry loops against a dead executor produce nothing a handoff would not.
- After Pi reload/restart: follow Session pickup, reconcile exact native run IDs and terminal artifacts, current refs and store rows. Do not assume local workers died or restart unknown live work. pi-goal pauses on reload and needs explicit user resume. Recompute the qualified frontier before accepting late results.

#### Escalation

Reaches the human, batched into the status page rather than per item: irreversible actions (force-push to shared branches, deploys, deletions, closing someone else's PR), genuine product or preference calls no experiment settles, a standing order that contradicts observed reality, a program-level dead end that survived a replan. Park each as a `gates.md` entry before asking, and route work around it.

Routine authorized frontier/status bookkeeping needs no extra approval. Missing capabilities, infrastructure failures, installs, scope changes and unresolved product choices do reach the owner. Log decisions without inventing autonomy beyond the user's grant.

Mid-run discoveries fix only what blocks the frontier. Everything else parks in follow-ups; at this fan-out a small scope leak multiplies into PRs nobody asked for.

**Reply:** at checkpoints and close: the predicate and the count against it from `units.tsv` and `ledger.tsv`, tracks and what each landed, the frontier (PR list plus SHAs), verdicts summary, what was abandoned and why, gates awaiting the human (the only asks), the store path, and the trail path. Numbers from the tables, not narrative. Include PR links.
