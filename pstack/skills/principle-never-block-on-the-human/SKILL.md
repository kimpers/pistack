# Never Block on the Human

The human supervises asynchronously. Agents must stay unblocked. Make reasonable decisions, proceed, and let the human course-correct after the fact.

**Why:** Every permission pause stalls the pipeline and makes the human the bottleneck. Since code changes are reversible and reviewable, a wrong decision usually costs less than blocking.

**Pattern:**
- **Proceed, then present.** Do the work, show the result. Don't ask "should I do X?" Do X, explain why.
- **Make the system self-healing.** When you notice a problem, log it and fix it in the next round.

**Boundaries:**
- **Irreversible actions** (force-push, delete production data, send external messages) still require confirmation.
- **Reversible actions** (write code, edit notes, split tasks) proceed only within authorized scope and harness permissions. Installs, scope changes and unresolved product choices still require approval.
- **Product direction** comes from the human; *execution* should not block.
